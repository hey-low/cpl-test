  Decarbonization efforts and net-zero targets are no longer just aspirations‚Äîthey‚Äôre becoming standard business imperatives, driven by evolving ESG global regulations. Beyond compliance, these efforts are crucial for safeguarding your brand‚Äôs reputation and earning stakeholder trust. They also present opportunities to create business value or save money. Whether you use OKRs or another framework to measure success, integrating environmentally focused objectives alongside your business goals ensures alignment across teams. That alignment requires that everyone in your organization is committed to those goals. 

  A structured approach, including carbon accounting to accurately track and manage emissions, transforms ambition into a tangible and effective emissions reduction strategy.

do: |
  - Identify an expert in digital sustainability with clear support from leadership and with allocated resources (employees and budget)
  
  - Research if any global regulations such as CSRD, SEC apply to your company and use case based on revenue and geographic location of the business
  
  - Have a look at the [Science Based Targets Initiative](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) (SBTi) and its recommendation for 50% emissions reduction by 2030 (on [all three scopes](https://ghgprotocol.org/blog/you-too-can-master-value-chain-emissions)) with a 90% long-term target for 2040 or 2050.
  
  - Focus on cutting emissions by 90% first, then [remove or offset the remaining 10%](https://www.shopify.com/climate/buy-carbon-removal) (according to the SBTi Net Zero Standard)
  
  - [**Choose the right metrics**](choose-the-right-metrics)
  
  - Define some [inspiring climate-specific](https://successindepth.com/smart-goals-for-sustainability/) and outcome-oriented objectives (e.g. reduce digital carbon footprint by 5% by the end of the quarter)
  
  - Embed climate-related Key Results in non-climate Objectives (e.g. reduce cloud bill as part of a profit maximization objective)
  
  - Include an environmental input into your prioritization framework, on top of the business and user values
  
  - Influence and speak the language of other departments to build connections and ensure alignment to your sustainability OKRs.
  
  - [Track your digital footprint](track-your-digital-footprint), set up dashboards and monitor after each release or sprint
  
  - Report on environmental progress and % of completion on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis. It should not be any different than other Key Results.
