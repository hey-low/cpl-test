  Focusing on digital emissions and impact is critical to building a coherent plan to start or accelerate your sustainability journey. Whether you manage a website, a platform or an app, there are different service providers, tools, and platforms to help you measure your impact and build a compelling pathway to sustainability.

do: |
  - [**Choose the right metrics**](https://www.notion.so/Choose-the-right-metrics-152e32ff00fd81248ef4e412309806b4?pvs=21)
  
  - Figure out whether you have the resources internally to undertake an initial audit and ongoing measurement, or if you may need to outsource this phase
  
  - Start small and grow gradually. Identify the low hanging fruits of your product line/supply chain where you have data available.
  
  - Breakdown your product by functional units: a page (e.g. homepage), a user flow, a set of features (e.g. authentication), an API, an AI model, or a squad (e.g. payment)
  
  - Identify the top 5 most frequently viewed pages, features, or user flows and measure their page weight and emissions.
  
  - It‚Äôs better to estimate rather spend a lot of resources and attempt to measure accurately. It‚Äôs more important to establish a baseline.
  
  - Estimate aggregated page weight and emissions for features or user flows
  
  - Estimate emissions from underlying services: APIs, Cloud, and third parties
  
  - For websites, there are some great free tools that can help you to get started and measure simple web pages, such as [Ecograder](https://ecograder.com/) or [Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co/). You can also get a Digital Ratings or Score using [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/digital-carbon-ratings/) or [eco Index](https://www.ecoindex.fr/) - the latter is available only in French.
  
  - Other tools offer specific measurements depending on your needs, such as [CO2.js](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2-js/) for websites, apps, and platforms, [Greenframe](https://github.com/marmelab/greenframe-cli) or [Greenspector](https://greenspector.com/) for user scenarios or web and mobile applications, [Step CI](https://stepci.com/) for APIs, or [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/) for cloud services
  
  - You can understand the impact of existing third parties with [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [Are my third parties green](https://aremythirdpartiesgreen.com/)
  
  - We recommend that you go with tools designed with companies like yours in mind that offer specialized features for your industry. You can consider, for example [fruggr.io](https://www.fruggr.io/), [Verdikt](https://verdikt.io/), [Sopht](https://sopht.com/en/product/), [Resilio](https://resilio-solutions.com/en), or [Greenframe](https://github.com/marmelab/greenframe-cli) if you're ready to invest in a commercial solution
  
  - Make sure measurements include impacts from devices, networks, and data centers across their life cycle (manufacturing, distribution, usage, to end of life)
  
  - When launching a new service/ product assess expected impact from increasing user adoption, including possible rebound effects and the product's true consequences.
  
  - Compare your metrics against industry benchmarks (such as Software Carbon Intensity from the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation)) or competitors if possible

  - Communicate findings, prioritize the biggest reduction opportunities with your team, and build a roadmap accordingly

success: |
  - üåç Collective efforts to gauge and reduce ecological footprints 
  - üåç Cross-departmental participation in green initiatives

consider: |
  You‚Äôll need to [Influence and collaborate with internal stakeholders](https://www.notion.so/Influence-and-collaborate-with-internal-stakeholders-152e32ff00fd81a3a06af685d3ba01a4?pvs=21) to perform such audits. Learning how to speak to all departments and understanding how everyone would benefit from knowing more about their digital footprint will be key. Consider securing a budget to hire specialists. Convert sustainability metrics into metrics they care about - speed, cost, security, value etc.

  As described above, you‚Äôll find many free and open-source tools and digital-specific carbon accounting companies (this market is growing fast, especially in Europe). Here‚Äôs a [list of tools and companies the Green Software Foundation](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/awesome-green-software#web) recommends. We recommend solutions that can be measured on an ongoing basis and ideally provide tailored recommendations for your product or business.
