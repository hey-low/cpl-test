  Bringing other departments onto your wavelength will have a big impact on the climate journey of your company. It will be important to educate, collaborate, and convince internal stakeholders of why climate action is important, why it's urgent, and what you can do about it. Communicate on a few high-impact items first, and then as your organization progresses, continue to push sustainability actions further. Shine a light on what can be achieved, communicate realistic expectations, and place emphasis on the opportunities that would be created by being more climate-conscious.

do: |
  - Do your research on individuals' or departments' goals and demonstrate how an environmental approach can potentially help them achieve their goals.

  - Consider the objectives of each stakeholder's respective manager, not just the stakeholders themselves. We‚Äôre all part of a bigger context.

  - Find leaders, decision-makers, and supporters in all key departments, such as Engineering, Design, Marketing, Data, Sales, Executives, etc.

  - Engage with them, listen to their objectives and concerns, and avoid moralizing

  - Articulate and tailor each stakeholder's benefits and opportunities based on what‚Äôs important for them so they can reuse these insights and data points when supporting your initiative (especially useful when you're not in the room)

  - Share industry examples and emerging trends to create a sense of urgency and encourage action (put simply, create professional FOMO - Fear of Missing Out).

  - Highlight the additional opportunities beyond sustainability; for example, an accessible website can tap into new audiences due to an enhanced user experience which can lead to better resource utilisation. All of these benefits have a positive environmental aspect by promoting sustainable business practices and reducing digital waste.

  - Celebrate and recognize individuals and teams contributing to sustainability

consider: |
  We recommend using simple and powerful examples that are easy to remember and envision. Encourage open dialogue and adapt strategies based on stakeholder input. 

  As a product leader, remember that your actions speak louder than your words. However, it is important to use shared language and priorities to help the conversation feel less threatening and more exciting. 
  
  Demonstrate your impact on your users, business, and climate metrics. It's easier to follow a path that has already been established than to be the first mover. Blaze the trail for others and support them to join you on your journey. They may then be inspired to make changes in their own circle of influence.
