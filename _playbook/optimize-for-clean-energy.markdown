  In the era of green computing, optimizing code to leverage low electricity demand and a ‚Äòclean grid‚Äô (e.g., mostly powered by renewable or nuclear energy) is essential. Efficient code reduces server load, thus conserving energy. When timed with clean grid availability, the environmental impact is minimized, furthering sustainable software development and mitigating climate change contributions.

do: |
  - Integrate systems to notify when clean energy is abundant

  - Schedule high-intensity tasks during periods of low electricity demand or allow your users to do so

  - Use auto-scaling systems that increase server availability as the grid becomes greener in order to process more tasks and jobs

  - Opt for cloud services emphasizing clean energy sources (see [Choose a sustainable hosting provider](choose-a-sustainable-hosting-provider))

  - Training AI models during low electricity demand periods (e.g., during the night) and during peaks in renewable energy production.

success: |
  - üí∞ Optimization leading to reduced cloud expenditure

  - üåç¬†Energy efficiency measures leading to decreased consumption

  - üåçüí∞ Adoption of cleaner electricity sources for operations

consider: |
  When aiming to align software operations with energy efficiency, it's imperative to remain up to date on grid trends and innovations. Collaboration with hosting providers can offer insights into best practices and access to clean energy sources. Regularly monitoring and adjusting strategies based on operational needs and grid conditions ensures optimal results. Lastly, @Influence and collaborate with internal stakeholders ensures that developers and stakeholders prioritize these initiatives.
