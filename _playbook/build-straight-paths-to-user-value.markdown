  Keeping your users on your product for longer sessions may not necessarily translate into better business resultsâ€”they may get lost or distracted and leave. Whatâ€™s certain, though, is that the longer they use it, the more greenhouse gasses releases are generated through energy use and data processing. The good news? You donâ€™t have to choose between user needs and sustainability. Designing just enough to meet user needs keeps things clear and focused, which users loveâ€”and itâ€™s leaner and greener too. Cut the fluff, keep it short and sweet!

  - [Validate the user journey and needs](validate-the-user-journey-and-needs)

  - [Prioritize a mobile-first approach](prioritize-a-mobile-first-approach)

  - [Remove non-essential features from the scope](remove-non-essential-features-from-the-scope)

  - Ideate and A/B test on early-stage solutions and compare their environmental impact

  - Make key features accessible in the navigation and on key pages

  - Optimize content for search

  - Empower users by providing transparent information and avoiding manipulative dark patterns to encourage them to make informed decisions and reduce their environmental impact.

  - Leverage user metrics to streamline and improve the user experience

  - Prototype and test user interactions and key hypotheses before development

  - Gather user feedback at each stage to refine the journey

  - Use shorter user journeys and cleaner UIsâ€”they contribute to low energy use, low data storage, fewer page loads, and fewer opportunities to overuse features and functionalities, while also improving performance through faster response times

success: |
  - ðŸ§‘ðŸ’° Accelerated development cycles emphasizing efficient resource use
  
  - ðŸ§‘ðŸ’° Enhanced user experience leading to improved conversion rates and overall satisfaction
  
  - ðŸ§‘ðŸ’° Reduction in maintenance costs, reflecting efficient design and execution
  
  - ðŸ’° Optimization leading to reduced cloud expenditure

consider: |
  We encourage you to provide the best experience while removing the fluff that doesnâ€™t serve the brand or the business. [Reuse and recycle](reuse-and-recycle) existing features can help you avoid reinventing the wheel and reduce your scope.
  If your entire business relies on the attention economy, this best practice might not be as easy as it is for other businesses or products, but there are still some valuable takeaways you could implement to streamline your user experience.
