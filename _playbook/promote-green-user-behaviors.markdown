  Individuals play a crucial role in addressing the climate and biodiversity crises through electing governments and influencing societal change. While some consumers actively engage and expect businesses to take environmental action, not everyone will embrace environmentalism immediately. Education remains essential for building awareness, empowering mindful choices, and advancing sustainability.
  Businesses must also take responsibility by making sustainable choices the default in their products. This approach reduces friction for users and increases adoption of green features and behaviours.

do: |
  - Make the sustainable option the default one for your product as much as possible (e.g. choosing the lowest carbon-emitting option for users: itinerary, delivery method, product, enabling carbon-aware charging features, etc.)

  - Show emissions reduction benefits to users in simple terms (e.g. cost reduction, % of CO2 saved vs another product or usage, and other relevant environmental and societal benefits)

  - Encourage users to choose the more sustainable option (e.g. electric car vs. regular car for a car manufacturer, train vs. plane trip for a transportation company)

  - Send tips and nudges to encourage users to delay or reduce the use of products or services when resources are scarce (e.g. water in summer, electricity during peak hours)

  - Enable users to see the impact of their actions: emissions reduction and positive impact of initiatives supported. However, it is important to note that you should not shift environmental responsibility onto end users. This responsibility falls on you and your company.

  - Recognize and reward eco-conscious user action

success: |
  - üßë Increased adoption of product features that promote sustainability

  - üßë Positive reception and user engagement with eco-friendly features

  - üåç¬†Energy efficiency measures leading to decreased consumption

  - üåçüí∞ Adoption of cleaner electricity sources for operations

  - üåç Established targets for reduced carbon and greenhouse gas emissions

consider: |
  When communicating with users, especially to influence behavior, work closely with your Marketing and Product Marketing teams. The right tone and content are essential‚Äîavoid moralizing and focus on a positive, uplifting approach.
  Empathy is crucial. Use relatable, real-life examples to illustrate benefits in meaningful ways (see [*Green Nudges](https://www.green-nudges.com/)* for inspiration). Simply citing CO‚ÇÇe savings or comparing them to cars taken off the road won't resonate with everyone. Instead, research your audience, understand their values, and frame your message in ways that feel personally relevant and compelling.
  Be sure to validate through user testing how your changes affect long-term user behavior.

  <span class="highlight">[Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/), an online platform for booking train and bus tickets in Europe, showcases the reduction in CO2 emissions when choosing to travel by train instead of a car. This not only strengthens the perceived value of their platform but also educates their users about the environmental benefits of train travel.</span>
