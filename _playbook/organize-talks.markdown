  Making climate a central consideration for your company will require business-wide support and shared ambition. 
  
  Bringing everybody to the same level of enthusiasm might require some help. Trust that there are plenty of experts and organizations that specialize in just what you need to mobilize your team and are ready to help you inspire motivation. This could be through climate action talks, awareness about sustainable digital, or promoting green IT.
do: |
  - Understand the general climate literacy and digital climate literacy of your organization (e.g. low carbon design, green engineering, sustainable investments)
  
  - Invite guest speakers and host regular events, webinars and meetups on best sustainable and environmental practices (as an organization and for specific job functions such as product managers, designers, etc...)
  
  - Hire experts to deliver training and interactive workshops to develop new skills and empower leadership, your team and internal stakeholders to take climate action
  
  - Offer ongoing or on-demand training courses or regular training so all new and existing employees develop the required skills
  
  - Develop training modules internally if you have a strong, sustainable digital culture
  
  - Create a repository of sustainable climate resources, articles, and best practices (feel free to include us!)
  
  - Encourage employees to share climate and sustainable initiatives and ideas (from your company or seen elsewhere)
  
  - Organize a climate hackathon
  
  - Launch internal campaigns highlighting the importance of sustainability
  
  - Create a sustainable skills development program based on the level of expertise and job function of employees
  
  - Track awareness progress: % of employees trained (or % of the product team trained), adoption and consultation of online resources available, attendance of webinars, talks, and meetups, etc.
success: |
  - üåçCollective efforts to gauge and reduce ecological footprints
  
  - üåçCross-departmental participation in green initiatives
  
  - Employee retention
consider: |
  We invite you to explore the training programs offered by the [Green Software Foundation](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) (recommended for engineers) and [Product for Net Zero](https://productfornetzero.com/) (recommended for designers, product managers, and strategists). If you're unsure where to find experts or companies that can provide talks or training, there are several online groups and communities that can guide you in the right direction. Consider joining MCJ, ClimateAction.tech, [Terra.do](http://Terra.do) or Work On Climate, among others.
  
  Don‚Äôt forget to engage with the Human Resources and Culture department. They will be instrumental in effectively raising awareness within your organization and creating momentum. We recommend covering various topics for all job functions and asking for feedback to tailor the content and approach. This will help you stay in tune with what people need to improve and have a greater climate impact. Shifting the culture doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, but it can be an exciting journey.
