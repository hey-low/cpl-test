  Creating a voluntary climate working group or committee within an organization demonstrates a grassroots commitment to sustainability. Driven by passionate individuals, these initiatives serve as catalysts for environmental action, advocating for meaningful measures and aligning efforts with broader climate goals.
  
  Taking proactive steps at the voluntary level signals genuine concern, inspires broader organizational change, and can help convince management that sustainability matters to employees.

  - Include representatives from various departments to ensure diverse insights based on expertise and backgrounds
  
  - Define the working group's short-term and long-term environmental goals with a realistic action plan
  
  - Find allies and find ways to get sponsorship and support from the top management
  
  - Demonstrate economic value in the short term to create momentum
  
  - Schedule periodic reviews with top management to monitor progress and recalibrate objectives
  
  - Collaborate with environmental consultants or NGOs for specialized insights
  
  - Encourage the dedication of funds, tools, and training for the committee's operations
  
  - Leverage tools like [ClimateFresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/) or [2Tonnes](https://en.2tonnes.org/) for climate education and awareness

success: |

consider: |
  To ensure the efficacy of a climate working group, its objectives must align with the company‚Äôs broader mission and values. The company‚Äôs actions are then influenced by the working group. 
  
  Regular training keeps members updated on global climate trends and best practices. The working group may not have all the answers, therefore their actions should be focused on  exploration, critique, discussion, and encouraging the organization to adopt a growth mindset. 
  
  Transparent communication channels within the working group and with the broader organization are paramount. By celebrating milestones, even small ones, the group can maintain momentum and inspire broader organizational commitment.
  
  Lastly, being receptive to feedback and adaptable to a changing climate ecosystem ensures the working group remains relevant and impactful.
