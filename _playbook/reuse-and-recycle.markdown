  Reusing and recycling code reduces development time and cost and conserves energy. As servers process fewer tasks, energy usage and the carbon footprint of software development diminish. Thus, your software development becomes more climate-considerate (and more cost effective simultaneously). 
  
  Some examples of code [efficiency](https://biosistemika.com/blog/good-practices-for-sustainable-software-development/) include: leveraging existing data transfer pipelines (rather than creating new ones), testing heavily to ensure code is efficient, which reduce maintenance work in the future, and modularizing code components. Modularizing your code base greatly reduces your product's overall carbon footprint by measuring each function's impact.

do: |
  - Perform benchmark activities, draw inspiration from others, and reuse existing successful patterns in development and design.

  - Use a Design System with reusable design components and sustainable components.

  - Define specifications for functions and modules that can be reused across projects.

  - Make use of well-documented existing libraries rather than building functionalities from scratch.

  - Share and use open-source solutions to avoid duplicating efforts.

  - Regularly update and improve existing code to ensure it remains reusable.

  - Write detailed documentation, making code more understandable and easier to repurpose.

  - Thoughtfully plan system architecture. Think with reuse in mind before your team starts writing code.

  - With legacy products, prioritize opportunities to reduce technical debt and clean up the existing code base.

  - üåç Established targets for reduced carbon and greenhouse gas emissions

consider: |
  Not all purposes or contexts may require the reuse of existing code, especially if you have a very old piece of software or security and intellectual property considerations. It's vital to maintain a balance between generic and project-specific code to ensure the optimal recycling and reuse of code. 
  
  Proper documentation is key as it ensures longevity and comprehensibility. Quality control is paramount: reused code should be thoroughly tested to ensure it doesn't introduce errors or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, fostering a culture that values sustainability in terms of product delivery and environmental responsibility is a driver for success.
  
  As a rule of thumb, if you can use open source code or existing code to solve your user problem, start there. When exploring AI solutions, you can also check out: [Chapter 2 - Build sustainable AI products](build-sustainable-ai-products).
