  Think Minimum Viable Product (MVP) here. We know that eliminating non-essential features reduces the cost of your project, streamlines development, reduces product bloat, reduces storage costs, and minimizes technical debt and environmental impact. While this is a challenging task, the benefits for your users, business, and the environment make it incredibly worthwhile.
  
  Ultimately, what is good for the environment is good for your users.

do: |
  - [Validate the user journey and needs](validate-the-user-journey-and-needs)

  - Prioritize user stories using the [User Story Mapping](https://storiesonboard.com/user-story-mapping-basics.html) technique (range reduction)

  - Imagine an MVP, V1, and V2 of each story (depth reduction)

  - Split your user stories into different releases

  - Keep only the must-haves

  - Regularly review and reassess feature relevance

  - [Avoid obsolescence tactics](avoid-obsolescence-tactics)

success: |
  - ðŸ§‘ðŸ’° Accelerated development cycles emphasizing efficient resource use

  - ðŸ§‘ðŸ’° Enhanced user experience leading to improved conversion rates and overall satisfaction

  - ðŸ§‘ðŸ’° Reduction in maintenance costs, reflecting efficient design and execution

  - ðŸ’° Optimization leading to reduced cloud expenditure

  - ðŸ’° Rigorous data security measures ensuring compliance and protecting user trust

consider: |
  Try your best to be critical about why you include user stories in the MVP: What would happen if you removed a user story from the MVP? Would the user experience or business goals be drastically damaged? If not, you may remove it from the scope. Celebrate the removal of non-essentials as a win. Itâ€™s a win for your users and the climate.
  
  Finally, keep in mind the [3 Uâ€™s rule](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/useful-usable-used-3us-key-successful-digital-richard/). Is the feature going to be **useful, usable, and used**? This should help you to include only features you have high confidence in. 
  If your company already uses [MoSCoW Prioritization](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/moscow-prioritization/), you can modify it by ordering features by climate impact within each category (must have, should have, could have, wish to have).
  
  Also, because we all know perfection doesnâ€™t exist, you will still have the opportunity to [Kill unused features](kill-unused-features). However, this is not an ideal approach and will come at a price for your product, the business, and the environment.
