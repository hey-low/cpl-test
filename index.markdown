# Digital Is Physical

The digital revolution, while transformative, carries a profound
environmental footprint. It is estimated that the Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) sector alone accounts for
approximately 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions—a figure larger
than the entire aviation industry and equivalent to road freight. With
projections suggesting that this number may reach up to 14% by 2040,
the consequences for our climate and biodiversity cannot be overstated. 

This playbook seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked fact that 
the digital world is indeed physical: tethered to the environment in a
multitude of ways. Every byte of data, every online transaction, and every
digital innovation leaves a mark on our planet. It's crucial to recognize
that the servers, data centers, end-user devices, and vast infrastructure
enabling our digital experiences are grounded in physical reality,
consuming environmental resources and energy.
