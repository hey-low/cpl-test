  Decarbonization efforts and net-zero targets are becoming
  the new norms and key for your brand reputation and trust.
  Whether or not you use OKRs or an alternative approach to
  quantifying your successes, setting environmentally-focused
  objectives alongside your business goals, that the whole team can
  get on board with, is the difference between an ambition, and a
  successful emissions reduction strategy.

do: |
  - Identify an expert in digital sustainability with clear support
  from leadership and with allocated resources (employees and
  budget)

  - Have a look at the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and
  its recommendation for 50% emissions reduction by 2030 (on
  all three scopes) with a 90% long-term target for 2040 or 2050.

  - Focus on cutting emissions by 90% first, then remove or offset
  the remaining 10% (according to the SBTi Net Zero Standard)

  - Choose the right metrics

  - Define some inspiring climate-specific and outcome-oriented
  objectives (e.g. reduce digital carbon footprint by 5% by the end
  of the quarter)

  - Embed climate-related Key Results in non-climate Objectives
  (e.g. reduce cloud bill as part of a profit maximization objective)

  - Include an environmental input into your prioritization
  framework, on top of the business and user values

  - Track your digital footprint, set up dashboards and
  monitor after each release or sprint

  - Report on environmental progress and % of completion on a
  weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis. It should not be any
  different than other Key Results.

success: |
  - A clearly articulated vision and mission
  underscoring commitment to societal and global
  challenges

  - Cross-departmental participation in green
  initiatives

  - Adoption of cleaner electricity sources for
  operations

  - Established targets for reduced carbon and
  greenhouse gas emissions
  
  - Employee retention reflecting a positive and
  sustainable work environment

consider: |
  A lot of groundwork needs to happen before succeeding in
  prioritizing climate or environmental OKRs. Organize talks,
  raise awareness, and promote training, Set up a climate
  working group, and Convince and collaborate with
  internal stakeholders will be needed to maximize your
  chances.

  In the meantime, you can also apply best practices from the next
  2 chapters: avoiding building useless stuff, considering hardware
  impacts, striping and simplifying your experience, decluttering
  your product, etc. 
  
  There are climate-positive product management decisions and
  best practices that wonâ€™t require your whole organization or
  executive team to approve (such as setting a page weight limit 
  in your Definition of Done). Lead by example, showcase your
  success, and you will organically create a buzz around this 
  work stream.
