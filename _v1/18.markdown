  Understanding the source of your business emissions is
  important to prioritize the most effective pathway to reduce
  emissions. It will also help you to realize the contribution of digital
  technologies to the overall carbon footprint of your operations.

  Since most emissions originate from your supply chain (scope 3),
  measuring them can be challenging as you depend on suppliers
  to provide this information and data points.

  Nonetheless, as you cannot improve what you cannot measure,
  your journey towards sustainability must commence here in order
  to create a more impactful, deliberate, and effective action plan.

do: |
  - Connect with the right people: It could be your ESG team,
  sustainable leaders internally, or external providers with,
  ideally, some experience in digital emissions measurement
  
  - Quantify your company’s value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) carbon
  emissions and perform a cradle-to-grave lifecycle analysis on
  your product

  - Include impacts from devices, networks, and data centers
  across their life cycle (manufacturing, distribution, usage,
  to end of life)

  - Choose the right metrics and make sure you can measure
  them fairly quickly to begin assessing improvements
  Identify measurement frequency and who’s leading the effort

  - Pinpoint opportunities for emission reduction. Consider the top-
  line revenue opportunities (eg. customer acquisition, adoption of greener products, improved performance and UX, etc.) and
  bottom-line cost savings (lower hosting fees, streamlined
  development, etc.) when presenting your findings to the team.

  - Prioritize opportunities for emission reduction and build
  a roadmap accordingly

  - Repeat annually, or in line with your business development
  strategy

success: |
  - Collective efforts to gauge and reduce ecological
  footprints

  - Cross-departmental participation in green
  initiatives

consider: |
  As a product leader, it's important to recognize that your
  impact and influence can extend beyond the digital realm. As an
  example, if shipping emissions are a big chunk of the emissions
  profile of your e-commerce business, you could lower emissions
  by reducing the return rate of your physical product (by helping
  users buy the right product, at the right size, colour, specs, etc.)
  and by partnering with sustainable, electric local shipping
  companies.
  In 2022, approximately 16.5% of items purchased online were
  returned in the US. Imagine the impact you could make by
  offering a better purchasing experience! Read more on how to
  Influence your value chain and partners.
