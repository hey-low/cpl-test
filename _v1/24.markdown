  Zooming in on digital emissions and impact is critical 
  to building a coherent plan to start or accelerate your sustainable
  journey. Whether you manage a website, a platform or an app, there
  are different service providers, tools, and platforms to help you
  measure your impact and build a compelling pathway to
  sustainability.

do: |
  - Choose the right metrics

  Figure out whether you have the resources internally 
  to undertake an initial audit and ongoing measurement, 
  or if you may need to outsource this phase

  There are some great free tools that can help you to get started
  and measure simple web pages, such as Ecograder or Beacon -
  both powered by CO2.js. You can also get a Digital Ratings or
  Score using Sustainable Web Design or eco Index - the latter is
  available only in French.

  Other tools offer specific measurements depending on 
  your needs, such as CO2.js for websites, apps, and platforms,
  Greenspector for user scenarios or web apps, Step CI for APIs, or
  Cloud Carbon Footprint for cloud services

  You can understand the impact of existing third parties 
  with BuiltWith or Are my third parties green

  We recommend that you go with tools designed with companies
  like yours in mind that offer specialist features, such as fruggr.io,
  Verdikt, or Greenframe if you're ready to invest in 
  a comprehensive solution

  Make sure measurements include impacts from devices,
  networks, and data centers across their life cycle
  (manufacturing, distribution, usage, to end of life)


success: |
  Collective efforts to gauge and reduce ecological
  footprints

  Cross-departmental participation in green
  initiatives

consider: |
  As a product leader, it's important to recognize that your
  impact and influence can extend beyond the digital realm. As an
  example, if shipping emissions are a big chunk of the emissions
  profile of your e-commerce business, you could lower emissions
  by reducing the return rate of your physical product (by helping
  users buy the right product, at the right size, colour, specs, etc.)
  and by partnering with sustainable, electric local shipping
  companies.
  In 2022, approximately 16.5% of items purchased online were
  returned in the US. Imagine the impact you could make by
  offering a better purchasing experience! Read more on how to
  Influence your value chain and partners.
