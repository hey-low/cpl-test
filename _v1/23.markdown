  Even though all business contexts are different, a set of 
  key environmental metrics should help you drive positive impact.
  These metrics are generally greenhouse gas emissions (starting
  with carbon emissions), energy consumption, water consumption,
  resource use and depletion, water/air/soil pollution, ecotoxicity,
  biodiversity, etc. Some are more obvious than others, and you 
  won’t track them all on day one. 


  But metrics will be key to making informed and effective decisions
  to reduce your impact on the environment. Plus, you’ll see when
  you’re making progress.

do: |
  - Start simple, reliable, and consistent. You, your product team,
  and the data team must trust the data to be credible and
  convincing when interacting with stakeholders, and building
  momentum towards climate action.

  - Consider both absolute metrics (e.g. CO2e) and relative metrics
  (CO2e per page, visit, user, employee, revenue generated, etc.)

  - Factor different types of impact: greenhouse gas emissions 
  (in g of CO2e or kg of CO2e), Energy consumption (in kWh),
  Water consumption (in cl or l), depletion of natural resources,
  etc.

  - Measure data transfer parameters: page weight (in KB), number
  of requests, and load time (in s). Keep in mind that it will not be
  the absolute way to measure but it is a good starting point in
  your journey.

  - Use the right tools for your context and your needs. 
  See more in Track your digital footprint.

  - Report these metrics against OKRs and KPIs and include 
  those metrics in your ESG reporting

success: |
  - Collective efforts to gauge and reduce ecological
  footprints

  - Building trust through transparent data collection and
  valuable insights

consider: |
  We recommend keeping things simple at the beginning. If
  you don’t measure anything, go for a proxy (80% accuracy is
  better than not tracking anything). Observing trends consistently
  over time is more important than being 100% accurate, and will
  support you to identify the next steps and keep moving forward.


  Measuring your digital footprint once will be a major milestone
  and should be celebrated. From there, you could set up a
  dashboard and monitor environmental impact on an ongoing
  basis to measure progress (or regress)
