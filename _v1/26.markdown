  Your backlog holds great potential for engagement with
  your stakeholders and communicating what is important for the
  product moving forward and why. Refining it with your team is a
  great moment to incorporate and address climate considerations
  as part of the process. Once tickets are prioritized into a sprint, you will have identified and mitigated some climate risks and impacts.

do: |
  - Set environmental and emission reduction product goals and
  link them to the OKRs or other strategic goals. Connect them
  with tangible business and user opportunities and benefits to
  facilitate their adoption.
  - Build the business case by estimating environmental benefits
  and gains from the new service, product, or feature to convince
  stakeholders
  - Go beyond targeted users: consider non-users (persons
  impacted by your service directly or indirectly) and non-human
  persona (animals or the planet)
  - List environmental KPIs (more in Choose the right metrics)
  - Set a carbon budget for the initiative (or feature) and set alerts
  when the budget is exceeded
  - Consider environmental Key Failure Indicators (KFIs) to get
  alignment on non-acceptable scenarios (e.g. a feature or
  product being too energy-intensive or emitting too much
  carbon emissions for the business or user value created)
  - Scan consequences to complete the brief
  - Add a section for environmental considerations
  (listed as risks, uncertainties, or opportunities)
  - Identify and prioritize risks based on two factors: probability
  or likelihood, and impact. Then, identify actions to eliminate or
  mitigate them
  - Define feature life expectancy and conditions/triggers for
  retirement
  - Explore opportunities to Promote green user behaviours
  - Track your digital footprint: know which tools you plan
  to use to measure, include dashboards as part of the scope, and
  monitor after the release or sprint


success: |
  - Inclusion of environmental metrics in product analytics
  and reporting
  - Cross-departmental participation in green initiatives
  - Adoption of cleaner electricity sources for operations
  - Established targets for reduced carbon and greenhouse
  gas emissions

consider: |
  Like any brief or team alignment exercise, the hard part of
  the process happens before the meeting. You should start by
  educating your peers, researching, finding compelling data
  points to support your case, and benchmarking the competition
  to create some internal FOMO.
  
  To increase your chances of success and be ready for these
  discussions, we'll delve more deeply into how to Convince
  and collaborate with internal stakeholders in the last
  chapter. Also, make sure to onboard your marketing team. They
  will be a great ally to make sustainability shine internally and
  with your users. This is another excellent opportunity to create
  positive momentum! More on Share your commitment,
  actions, and journey publicly.
