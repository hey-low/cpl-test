## Our Board

### Antoine Cabot

</div>

I work as a Senior Product Manager at Salesforce,
where I am deeply engaged in the advancement of digital
process automation. My professional journey is characterized
by a commitment to leveraging software solutions to
enhance operational efficiency across diverse organizations.

I strive to integrate sustainable practices into the core of
product development, ensuring that the digital solutions
I oversee are environmentally conscious and contribute
positively to the planet. This dedication to sustainability is
a reflection of my belief in the importance of corporate
responsibility in addressing environmental challenges.

My vision is to blend technological innovation with
sustainable practices, creating a synergy that leads to
solutions which are not only efficient and effective but also
environmentally sound. The goal is to set a precedent in the
tech industry, demonstrating how digital automation can go
hand-in-hand with ecological stewardship.

In both my personal and professional life, I am committed
to exploring and implementing strategies that promote sustainability. From reducing air travel to moving to a plant-based diet, this commitment is an integral part of my identity, influencing the way I approach product management and shaping the future of digital process automation in a way that respects and preserves our planet.

### François Burra

As a Product Lead and UX strategic consultant, I have spent
over a decade collaborating with startups and agencies across
Canada and the US. Rooted in my background in social
entrepreneurship and international business, I have always
sought to make a positive societal impact through my work.

In 2020, I co-founded a groundbreaking vegan investment club
in Canada, aiming to democratize vegan investing. Additionally,
I actively engage in policy advocacy and promote the transition
to plant-rich diets for environmental and ethical reasons.

After working as the Product Lead for a Canadian FinTech
acquired for $64M in 2021, I decided to take almost a full year off
to focus on personal growth. During this time I underwent therapy
to help me reconnect with myself and my intuition, and reignited
my creativity.

This inward journey led me to immerse myself in climate studies,
awakening me to the profound impact of digital technology and
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) on the climate
crisis and biodiversity. Fuelled by this realization, I redirected my
career toward confronting the climate emergency head-on. My
focus shifted to assisting digital peers, product teams, and
companies in harnessing the power of the net zero opportunity
and reducing their digital emissions.

I now train product teams on sustainable digital practices (with
[Product for Net Zero](https://productfornetzero.com/){:target="_blank"}), help companies measure digital footprint
(with [fruggr](https://www.fruggr.io/){:target="_blank"}), and build low-carbon experiences.

### Peter Stovall

Peter is an entrepreneurial product leader focused on enterprise tech, and passionate about the planet. He is the author of a number of articles on climate conscious product management. He met and introduced Antoine and Francois in 2022 when pivoting from professional services into climate tech, and subsequently joined the Climate Product Leaders board in 2024. Peter is currently helping the solar industry scale by building solar asset lifecycle management with Raptor Maps.

As a product leader, Peter's purpose is to create space for focused discovery and meaningful insights, empower rapid validation, and create processes that let us measure and repeat value creation. One of his favourite mantras is "go slow to go fast", and his drive for value avoids costly "product bloat" - features that don't get used and contribute to e-waste.
